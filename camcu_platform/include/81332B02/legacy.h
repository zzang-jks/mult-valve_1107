 * @brief Legacy functions still existing in some ROMs
 * @details Functions here are deprecated because of some deficiencies and were replaced by existing cleaner interface.
 *          Because they are still present in old ROMS and can be reused by FLASH applications of that ROMs, they are
 *          still present, but should not be used. If you want to use this just include legacy.h into your application.
 * @deprecated Functions in this group are deprecated and should not be used.
