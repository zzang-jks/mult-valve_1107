 * @brief library to drive the IO pins from software
 * @details
 * This library allows to access the IO pins from the firmware. It is always possible to read
 * IO pins as input, therefore there is no special configuration necessary. To drive an IO from
 * firmware, it has to be configured as output.
 * Interrupts on the different pins can be enabled. The ISR for each IO has to be implemented by the
 * application itself.
