 * @details The LIN transport layer is message based. Its intended use is to work as a transport
 *          layer for messages to a diagnostic message parser outside of the LIN device driver.
 *          Two exclusively alternative APIs exist, one raw that allows the application to control
 *          the contents of every frame sent and one cooked that performs the full transport layer function.
